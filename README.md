Instructions
Read each question carefully and write the corresponding JavaScript function.
Test your functions with at least two different sets of arguments to ensure they work as expected.
Comment your code to explain your logic where necessary.
Remember to use the appropriate function type (basic, arrow, or anonymous) as per the question's requirement.
Try to complete as many of these as you can today. Note where you get stuck and how long each problem takes you. Once I have that info I can help you decide which areas need more focus ðŸ™‚
